# 🧠 AI-Powered Job Recommendation System  

An **AI-powered job recommendation engine** that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to suggest jobs tailored to a user’s **skills, experience, and location**.  

Built using **Sentence Transformers**, **Flask**, and **scikit-learn**, this project demonstrates how intelligent job portals can go beyond keyword search to deliver **personalized, context-aware recommendations**.

## 🌍 Real-Time Extension

Right now, the system uses static CSV datasets.
For a real-time job portal, data can come from:

✔️Job APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed, Adzuna)

✔️Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)

✔️Company HR Databases

✔️User data can be collected via:

✔️Manual input (skills, experience, location)

✔️Resume upload (PDF/DOCX) with NLP parsing

## 🔮 Future Improvements

✔️📂 Resume Upload & Parsing

✔️🎯 Collaborative Filtering (behavior-based recs)

✔️📈 Skill Gap Analysis (suggesting courses)

✔️☁️ Cloud Deployment (Render, Streamlit, AWS)
